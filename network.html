<h1>Networking & The Internet</h1>


<table style="background-color:rgb(121, 104, 210);"></p>
<table style="width:100%">
  <h4>Network Classifications</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>LAN: Local Area Network</li>
        <li>PAN: Personal Area Network</li>
        <li>WAN: Metropolitan Area Network</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Network Models</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Bus Network: Machines are all connected to a common communication line</li>
    <li>Star Network: One machine serves as a central focal point to which all the others are connected</li>
</ul>
<h4>Protocols</h4>
<ul>
    <li>CSMA/CD Ethernet: (Carroer Sense, Multiple Access with Collison Detection) dictates
        that each message be broadcast to all the machines on the bus.</li>
    <li>CSMA/CD Wifi: (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance) the policy
        of trying to avoid collisions rather than trying to detect them.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Combining Networks:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Repeater: A device that passes signals back and forth between the two original buses</li>
    <li>Bridge: Connects two buses, but it does not necessarily pass all the messages across the connection</li>
    <li>Switch: A bridge with multiple connections, allowing it to connect several buses rather than just two</li>
    <li>Router: Special purpose computers used for forwarding messages</li>
    <li>Gateway: Serves as a passageway between the network and the outside world</li>
</ul>
<h4>Client/Server Model:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>P2P: (peer-to-peer) whereas the client/server model involves one process (the server) providing a service to numerous other (clients)</li>
    <li>Distributed System: Consist of software units that execute as processes on different computers</li>
    <li>Cloud Computing: Huge pools of shared computers on the network can be allocated for use by clients as needed</li>
</ul>
<h4>Internet Addressing</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Tier  1: consist of very high-speed, high-capacity, international WANs</li>
    <li>Tier 2: More regional in scope and less potent in their capabilities</li>
    <li>Tier 3: Operated by a single authority that is in the business of supplying Internet access to individual homes and businesses</li>
</ul>
<h4>IP Address:</h4>
<ul>
    <li> ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers): a nonprofit corporation established to coordinate the Internet's operation. 
    <a href="https://www.icann.org/">www.icann.org</a>
    <li>DNS: Internet-wide directory system</li>
    <li>TLD (Top-Level Domain): Reflect the domain's classification</li>
    <li>Country-code TLDs: Two-letter TLDs for each specific country. <a href="https://www.worldstandards.eu/other/tlds/">www.worldstandards</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Internet Protocols:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Application for accessing another computer from a great distance</li>
    <li>HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol): Network applications handled by webpages</li>
    <li>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): A way that two computers on the network may interact when transmitting an email message from one host to another</li>
</ul>
<h4>World Wide Web:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>URL (Uniform Resource Locator): unique address</li>
    <li>Client-side activities: performed by a client</li>
    <li>Server-side activities: performed by a server</li>
</ul>
<h4>Internet four-layer software:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Application Layer: where a message typically originates</li>
    <li>Transport Layer: Used to send and receive messages over the Internet</li>
    <li>Network Layer: In charge of maintaining the router's forwarding table and using that table to determine the direction in which to forward packets</li>
    <li>Link Layer: In charge of receiving and transmitting the packets</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cybersecurity:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Malware: Many attacks incorporate the use of malicious software</li>
    <li>Virus: Software that infects a computer by inserting itself into programs that already reside in the machine</li>
    <li>Worm: An autonomous program that transfers itself through a network</li>
    <li>Trojan Horse: A program that enters a computer system disguised as a desirable program</li>
    <li>Spyware: Software that collects information about activities at the computer on which it resides and reports the information back to the instigator of the attack.</li>
    <li>Phishing: A technique of obtaining information explicitly by simply asking for it</li>
    <li>DDoS Attack: When the work of generating the attacks is distributed over many hosts</li>
</ul>
<h4>Protection:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Firewall: A primary prevention technique to filter traffic passing through a point in the network</li>
    <li>Spam Filter: Firewalls designed to block unwanted email</li>
    <li>Proxy Server: A software unit that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server with the goal of sheilding the client from adverse actions of the server</li>
    <li>Antivirus Software: Used to detect and remove the presence of known viruses and other infections</li>
    <li>Crytography: The study of sending and receiving messages securely in the presence of adversaries</li>
    <li>Public Key Encryption: Techniques by which the encryption and decryption algorithms are known, and one of the keys is known, but the encoded message remains secure</li>
</ul>
