<td><u>Object-oriented programming (OOP):</u></td>
<td>a software system is viewed as a collectio of units, called objects, each of which is capable of performing the actions that are immediately related to itself as well as requesting actions of other objects</td></tr>

<tr>
<td><u>Scripting language:</u></td>

<td>typically used to perform administrative tasks rather than to decelop complex programs</td></tr>
